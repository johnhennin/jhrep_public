[Shifu power on the ceiling. Tai Lung is shocked.]

TAI LUNG: The scroll has landed and restarts his pursuit. Via the magic of cookie- vision (He envisions the scroll. Shifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to Po.]

PO: That's what I thought.

[Shifu walks away, leaving the noodle cart behind.]
